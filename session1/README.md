# Session 1: Data Pipeline, Setup & Introduction to Programming

## Overview
 - Tuesday, 15th August, 2017
 - Time: 1 – 5 pm

#### Objectives
- [ ] Introduce learners to the data pipeline as a framework for working with data.
- [ ] Setup up at least one programming environment (R or Python) on each learner’s laptop 	
- [ ] Learn the basics syntax of R or Python necessary to work through the data pipeline. 	

#### Outcomes
- [ ] Each learner can explain the data pipeline from their own context to another learner.
- [ ] Each learner has successfully installed R and Python programming languages and environments on their laptops.
- [ ] Each learner can use either R or Python to explore a question with data in ord.
